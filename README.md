## Save and publish your changes

To save and publish your changes, scroll down and complete the information in the "Commit changes" box. Add a note about what you changed. This is an important part of version controlâ€”it allows other people (and even your future self!) to know what changes you made and why. 

For today, you can commit directly to the gh-pages branch, so you can see your changes immediately. If you were working collaboratively on a project with others, you would likely create a new branch and submit a pull request for someone else to review.
